# Python Learning Journey

This repository is a reflection of my ongoing learning process in Python. I am working through problems on a weekly basis, covering different levels of difficulty. The problems are categorized into three main areas: **Basics**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to Python problems. I am working on progressively harder challenges each week, starting with basic Python concepts and gradually advancing towards more complex topics like object-oriented programming (OOP) and API interaction.

## Learning Path

1. **Basics**:
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Strings
   - Lists, Tuples, and Sets
   - Dictionaries
   - Loops & Conditional Statements
   - Functions

2. **Intermediate**:
   - File Handling
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Error Handling
   - Modules and Libraries

3. **Advanced**:
   - API Interaction (REST APIs, HTTP requests)
   - Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)
   - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)

## Weekly Problems

Each week, I tackle a new set of problems within these categories:

### **Week 1 - Basics**
- Variables and Data Types
- Strings
- Lists, Tuples, Sets
- Loops and Functions

### **Week 2 - Intermediate**
- File Handling
- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.

### **Week 3 - Advanced**
- API Interaction with Python (requests, JSON)
- Data Structures: Stacks, Queues, Trees

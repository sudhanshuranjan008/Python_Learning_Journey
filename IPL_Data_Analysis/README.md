# IPL Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) data to derive insights, build transformations, and demonstrate practical data handling skills. The project is part of my Python and SQL learning journey, showcasing how Python integrates with SQL Server for data manipulation and analysis.

---

## Objectives
- Extract, transform, and load (ETL) IPL data.
- Perform advanced data analysis using Python and SQL.
- Generate insights such as player and team performance metrics, venue analysis, and trends over seasons.
- Create a structured pipeline for handling and analyzing large datasets.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `pyodbc`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)

---

## Planned Workflow
1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Pull IPL data from the SQL Server database.
   - Integrate additional data as required (e.g., player profiles, venue details).

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data.
   - Perform calculations such as strike rates, averages, and win/loss percentages.

3. **Data Loading:**
   - Store transformed data in SQL Server for further analysis.

4. **Analysis and Reporting:**
   - Write SQL queries for insights like:
     - Top players by season.
     - Team performance trends over years.
   - Visualize results using Python.

## Deliverables
- **Python Scripts:** Scripts for ETL and analysis.
- **SQL Queries:** Scripts for data transformations and querying.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs and plots showcasing key insights.
- **Documentation:** Clear project documentation for reproducibility.
